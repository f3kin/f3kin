- Hi, Iâ€™m @f3kin, a Third Year Mechatronics Student at Melbourne University
- I am interested in all things robotics and making, and I am always striving to make something meaningful that will change peoples' lives
- I am looking to collaborate on any open source or interesting projects
- Feel free to take a look at my profile to see the code that I have written for recent projects
- I am currently working on projects for two space-related clubs ðŸš€ (which can't be shared due to copyright) as well as other personal robotics and software ones
